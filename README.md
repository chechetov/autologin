This is a repo for autologging into agent environment

Built because I am lazy and now is outdated.

Main idea:
1. mount RamDisk
2. launch a script from there
4. manipulate Chrome through Selenium WebDriver
5. node.js handles google authenticator part
6. autoit handles Citrix Windows

Installation:
1. install ImDisk
2. compress repository into *.img file and put start.bat in the root folder
3. install start.bat in windows task scheduler
4. intall required python dependencies with pip (sorry no reqs.txt) + Visual Basic tools
5. go back to step 4 in case something is missing.
