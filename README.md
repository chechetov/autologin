This is a repo for autologging into agent environment

Built because I am lazy and now is outdated.

Main idea:
1. mount ramdisk
2. launch a script from there
4. manipulate chrome through selenium webdriver
5. node.js handles google authenticator part
6. autoit handles citrix windows

Installation:
1. install imdisk
2. compress repository into *.img file and put start.bat in the root folder
3. install start.bat in windows task scheduler
4. intall required python dependencies with pip (sorry no reqs.txt) + visual basic tools
5. go back to step 4 in case something is missing
